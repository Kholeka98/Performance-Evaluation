# Performance Evaluation Analysis 

## Project objective
The objective of this SQL project is to conduct a comprehensive performance analysis of four products based on their quantity sold and revenue generated. Through the utilization of SQL queries and database management techniques, this project aims to:
- **Analyze Product Performance**: Evaluate the sales performance of four products within a given timeframe by examining their respective quantities sold and revenue generated.
- **Identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Determine key metrics such as total revenue, average revenue per product, total quantity sold, and average quantity sold for each product.
- **Compare Product Performance**: Compare the performance metrics among the four selected products to identify trends, patterns, and disparities in sales volume and revenue generation.
- **Uncover Insights**: Extract actionable insights from the analysis to understand which products are performing well and which may require further attention or improvement strategies.
- **Inform Decision-Making**: Provide stakeholders with valuable insights to inform decision-making processes related to product management, marketing strategies, inventory planning, and resource allocation.

## About Data 
The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ksabishek/product-sales-data). This dataset contains quantity sold and revenue of four different products. The dataset description states: "This is a hypothetical dataset generated using python for educational purposes. It bears no resemblance to any real firm."

## Strategy 
1. **Dataset Prepation**
      - Data wrangling involved inspecting the dataset for null values and appropriately renaming columns based on their descriptions.
      - Build a database.
      - Define a table  and import NOT NULL data into the table.

2. **Feature Engineering**
